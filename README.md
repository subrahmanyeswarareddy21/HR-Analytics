3. Data Cleaning
Based on the project structure, it is assumed that the data has been cleaned and prepared for analysis. This step would typically involve handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data accuracy before analysis.

4. Data Modelling
The presence of multiple CSV files and an SQL script (HR Analysis SQL.sql) suggests that data modeling was a crucial step. This would involve creating relationships between different data tables to allow for a holistic and connected view of the HR data.

5. Insights

Employee Retention Analysis: The Employee Retention Analysis.pbix file indicates a primary focus on understanding why employees leave the company and identifying key factors that contribute to employee turnover. Insights would likely include an analysis of retention rates, factors affecting attrition, and recommendations for improvement.

Quarterly Performance: The Q1.csv through Q6.csv files suggest an analysis of data over several quarters, providing insights into trends in hiring, performance, and other key metrics on a quarterly basis.

Workforce Demographics: The analysis would provide insights into the composition of the workforce, including demographics like age, tenure, department, and location.

Key HR Metrics: The project would likely track important KPIs such as employee headcount, performance metrics, and salary distribution, as presented in the HR Analysis PPT.pptx file.

Conclusion

This HR analytics project provides a robust framework for understanding and managing a company's workforce. The analysis is geared toward identifying critical areas of concern, such as employee retention, and highlighting areas of strength. The findings can be used to develop targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and ultimately enhance overall business performance.
